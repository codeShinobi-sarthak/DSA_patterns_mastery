Haha 😄 **Digital DP** does sound like something cooked up by a sleep-deprived coder at 3 AM, right?

But don't worry — let's break it down *super simply*, step by step, in your style:

---

### 🔍 **What is Digital DP?**

**Digital DP (Digit Dynamic Programming)** is a **DP technique** used to solve problems related to **digits of a number**, especially when:

- You're asked to **count** how many numbers between `L` and `R` satisfy some **digit-related condition**.
- You're working with **large ranges** — say, up to `10^18`, so brute force is a big NO-NO ❌.

---

### 📌 **Typical Problem Statement**

> "Given two numbers `L` and `R`, count how many numbers between them have **no two same adjacent digits**."

Seems easy? Try brute-forcing it when `R = 10^18`. 💀

---

### 🧠 **Why "Digital" DP?**

Because we **deal with digits one by one**, just like you do in recursive digit-based problems (e.g., checking palindromes, digit sum, etc.).

---

### 🛠️ **Core Ideas in Digital DP**

Here’s the classic DP state breakdown:

```java
dp[pos][tight][someOtherFlag]
```

#### 🧩 1. `pos`:
Current digit position (e.g., tens, hundreds...).

#### 🧩 2. `tight`:
Whether the number formed **so far** is still equal to the prefix of the original number.

- If `tight = 1`: We're still bound by the original number.
- If `tight = 0`: We can use any digit from 0–9 now.

#### 🧩 3. `otherFlag(s)`:
Any other condition — like "has even sum", "has no repeated digits", etc.

---

### 🔁 How it Works (Step-by-Step)

1. You **convert the number to a string or array of digits**.
2. You **start from the most significant digit** and go left to right.
3. At each step, you **try all valid digits** from 0 to 9 (or up to the current digit if `tight == 1`).
4. You **memoize** results using `(pos, tight, ...flags)`.

---

### ✅ Common Problems Solved Using Digital DP:

- Count numbers with **at most k distinct digits**.
- Count numbers where **digit sum is divisible by k**.
- Count numbers with **no two consecutive digits same**.
- Count numbers where **digits are in non-decreasing order**.

---

### 🧠 Mental Model / Analogy

> Think of it like walking down the digits of a number, step by step, and at each step, choosing a digit smartly — but obeying the rules like not exceeding the original number, keeping track of tight bounds, etc.

---

### 💡 Bonus: It's usually used with **memoization** + **recursion**.

```java
int dp[pos][tight][someOtherFlag];
```

You can use HashMap or full arrays depending on constraints.

I can walk you through a classic problem with full Java code and visualization — like:

we’ll do it together. 💪

😎 Let's go step-by-step with a classic Digital DP problem — in **Java**, of course — and I’ll walk you through the **template**, **code**, and **visualization**.

---

## 🚀 Problem:
**Count numbers between `1` and `N` that do NOT contain the digit `4`.**

📥 Input:  
`N = 100`

📤 Output:  
Count of numbers in `[1, 100]` that don’t contain the digit `4`.

---

## 🎯 Goal:
We'll use **Digital DP** to count valid numbers ≤ N, digit by digit, and **avoid using `4`**.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Approach

### 1️⃣ Convert the number to digits:
We convert `N` to a string (so we can access digit-by-digit).

### 2️⃣ Define our DP state:
```java
dp[pos][tight]
```

- `pos` = current digit position we're processing
- `tight` = are we still restricted by the original number’s prefix?

No need for extra flags in this simple problem.

### 3️⃣ Recursion & Memoization:
We try placing digits from 0 to 9, but **skip 4**.

---

## 🧠 First: What’s the actual problem?

> You’re given a number `N = 100`.  
> You need to count how many numbers from `1` to `100` **don’t have the digit `4` in them**.

Example:  
Numbers like `14`, `24`, `94` ❌ (they have digit `4`)  
Numbers like `13`, `56`, `100` ✅ (no digit `4`)

---

## 😰 Why can’t we just loop?

You **can** for small numbers, but what if `N = 10^18`?  
A loop would take **forever**.

That’s where **Digital DP** comes in.

---

## 💡 What are we trying to do?

We want to **build numbers digit by digit**, **only allowing digits that don't include `4`**, but also **not going above N**.

And we use **recursion with memorization** (DP) to avoid redoing the same work.

---

## 🧱 Let’s build the logic in English first

### Step 1: Convert the number into a string

Why? Because we want to go through its digits easily, like this:
```text
N = 100 → digits = ['1', '0', '0']
```

We’ll process digits **left to right**, building valid numbers.

---

### Step 2: Define your state

Every recursive function will answer this:

> "From this digit position onward, how many valid numbers can I build?"

So, we define:

```java
helper(pos, tight)
```

- `pos`: which digit position are we at? (0, 1, 2, …)
- `tight`: are we still matching the upper bound (`N`)?

---

### Step 3: Base Case

If we reached the end of the number (no more digits to process), we successfully built a valid number.

```java
if (pos == num.length()) return 1;
```

---

### Step 4: Try all digits at this position

From `0` to `9`, **but skip 4**.

Also, if `tight == 1`, we can’t go above the current digit of `N`.  
If `tight == 0`, we can freely use `0` to `9`.

## 🧾 Simplified Java Code (With Logs)

Here’s the code again, with comments and print statements so you can follow what’s going on:

```java
public class DigitalDPDemo {

    static String numStr;
    static int[][] dp;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 100;
        System.out.println("Answer: " + countNumbersWithout4(N));
    }

    static int countNumbersWithout4(int N) {
        numStr = Integer.toString(N);  // Convert number to string
        int len = numStr.length();
        dp = new int[len][2]; // dp[pos][tight] — only 2 values for tight (0 or 1)

        // Fill dp with -1
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);
        }

        return helper(0, 1); // Start from first digit with tight = 1
    }

    static int helper(int pos, int tight) {
        if (pos == numStr.length()) {
            return 1; // Valid number formed
        }

        if (dp[pos][tight] != -1) {
            return dp[pos][tight];
        }

        int limit = (tight == 1) ? numStr.charAt(pos) - '0' : 9;

        int res = 0;

        for (int digit = 0; digit <= limit; digit++) {
            if (digit == 4) continue; // Skip 4s ❌

            int newTight = (tight == 1 && digit == limit) ? 1 : 0;

            res += helper(pos + 1, newTight);
        }

        dp[pos][tight] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
```

## 👀 What’s Actually Happening?

- It tries placing digits at every position.
- If `tight == 1`, we don’t go above the original digit.
- We **skip 4** every time.
- If we reach the end, we **count that number**.

---

## ✅ Result

> For `N = 100`, answer is `81`.  
There are 81 numbers from 1 to 100 that don’t contain the digit `4`.

---

## 📦 TL;DR (Too Lazy? Read this part!)

- Digital DP = process digits one by one using recursion + memoization.
- Use a `tight` flag to ensure you don’t go above the number `N`.
- You can modify this for other conditions (like digits must be even, sum of digits, etc.).
- Base case = when you’ve placed all digits → return 1 valid number.
- Skip `4` (or whatever the condition is).
- Boom 🔥 — works for huge `N` like `10^18`.
