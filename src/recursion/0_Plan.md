## 📚 RECURSION MASTER PLAN (DSA Pattern Series 📘)

### 🌱 **PHASE 1: Core Foundations (Understand the Soul of Recursion)**
> Learn what recursion *is* and how it *thinks*.

1. ✅ **What is Recursion?**
    - Definition
    - Recursion Tree 🧩
    - Base Case & Recursive Case
    - Call Stack Visualization 📊

2. ✅ **Types of Recursion**
    - Tail Recursion 🐍
    - Head Recursion 🧠
    - Tree Recursion 🌲
    - Indirect Recursion 🔁

3. ✅ **How Recursion Works (Internals)**
    - Memory (Stack Frames)
    - Stack Overflow
    - Debugging tip: Print statements at each level 🔍

### 🛠️ **PHASE 2: Baby Steps (Basic Practice Problems)**
> Get the rhythm of recursion 🎶

| Problem 💡                         | Pattern                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Factorial of a number             | Simple recursion       |
| Fibonacci numbers                 | Tree recursion         |
| Sum of N natural numbers          | Head/Tail recursion    |
| Reverse a string                  | Recursion + Strings    |
| Check if a number is palindrome  | Recursion + Math       |
| Power of a number (a^b)          | Divide & Conquer       |

📌 **Goal:** Write both **recursive** and **iterative** versions of each to compare.

### 🌿 **PHASE 3: Intermediate Level - More Thinking, Less Typing**
> Start building problem-solving intuition 🧠

| Problem 💡                              | Key Focus                    |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Print all subsets of a set             | Backtracking intro 🌌        |
| Generate all permutations of a string  | Swap-based recursion 🔄      |
| Binary Search (recursive version)      | Divide and Conquer 🗡️       |
| Palindromic partitioning               | Recursive thinking + Strings|
| Tower of Hanoi                         | Elegant classic 🗼           |

📌 **Add dry-run + tree diagram** for each function to visualize flow.

### 🧩 **PHASE 4: Recursion + Patterns = 🔥**
> Combine recursion with famous DSA patterns:

- 🔄 **Recursion + Backtracking**  
  ⮕ N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Rat in a Maze

- 🌳 **Recursion + Trees**  
  ⮕ Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversals  
  ⮕ Height/Depth of Tree  
  ⮕ Check Balanced Tree

- 🧵 **Recursion + Linked List**  
  ⮕ Reverse Linked List  
  ⮕ Find Kth node from end

---

### 🧠 **PHASE 5: Pattern Building & Template Mastery**
> Learn to create recursion templates

1. ⭐ Template 1: Subsequence pattern
2. ⭐ Template 2: Pick/Not Pick (Used in DP later)
3. ⭐ Template 3: Tree Recursion pattern (for permutations, N-Queens, etc.)

---

### 🔄 PHASE 6: Recursion to DP Transition (To Be Continued in other package (DP)...)
---

### 📅 Suggested Plan
| Week | Focus                                 |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Basics)             |
| 2    | Phase 3 (Intermediate Problems)        |
| 3    | Phase 4 (Mix with other DSA patterns)  |
| 4    | Phase 5 (Templates + DP Transition)    |

---

### ✅ PRO TIPS:
- Always define the **base case first**.
- Add print statements to **trace the recursion**.
- Use **recursion trees** for visualization.
- Practice 1 problem daily and try to **dry-run on paper** 📝
